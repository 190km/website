## GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket

## Git

For deployments from any Git repository, whether public or private, you can use either SSH or HTTPS:

### Public Repositories (HTTPS)

1. Enter the repository URL in `HTTPS URL`.
2. Type the branch name.
3. Click on `Save`.

### Private Repositories

For private repositories, is required to first create an SSH Key.

1. Go to [SSH Keys](/docs/core/ssh-keys/overview) and click on `Create SSH Key`.
2. Click on `Generate RSA SSH Key` and copy the `Public Key`.

You can then copy the SSH key and paste it into the settings of your account.

This enables you to pull repositories from your private repository, a method consistent across nearly all providers.
