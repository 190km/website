Dokploy offers a UI to manage your certificates.


We expose a UI to create and delete the certificates, we ask two fields:

1. **Name**: Enter a name for the certificate (this can be anything you choose).
2. **Certificate Data**: Provide the certificate details.
3. **Private Key**: Enter the private key.
4. **(Optional) Server**: If you want to create a certificate for a server, you can select it here.

<Callout type='warn'>
    This action will create the files, but that doesn't mean it will work automatically. You need to adjust the Traefik configuration to use it, this configuration will make
    to traefik can recognize the certificate.
