## GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket

1.  [Github](/docs/core/github) Guide.
2.  [Gitlab](/docs/core/gitlab) guide.
3.  [Bitbucket](/docs/core/bitbucket) guide.

## Git

For deployments from any Git repository, whether public or private, you can use either SSH or HTTPS:

### Public Repositories (HTTPS)

1. Enter the repository URL in `HTTPS URL`.
2. Type the branch name.
3. Click on `Save`.

### Private Repositories

For private repositories, is required to first create an SSH Key The Steps are almost similar for all providers.

1. Go to [SSH Keys Section](/docs/core/ssh-keys) and click on `Create SSH Key`.
2. Click on `Generate RSA SSH Key` and copy the `Public Key`.
3. Go to your Git Provider, either Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Gitea or any other.
4. Go to `Settings` and search for `SSH Keys`.
5. Click on `Add SSH Key`.
6. Paste the SSH Key and click on `Add Key`.


You can then copy the SSH key and paste it into the settings of your account.

This is for Github, but the same applies for Gitlab, Bitbucket, Gitea, etc.

This enables you to pull repositories from your private repository, a method consistent across nearly all providers,
remember to use the SSH URL `git@github.com:user/repo.git` and not the HTTPS URL `https://github.com/user/repo.git`.

## Docker

For Docker deployments:

- Provide a Docker image. For private repositories, enter the username and password.
